# Roles

**Roles** are predefined user groups or access levels that determine the actions and permissions users can have. For each access group, you can assign management privileges to administrators with roles. An administrator may manage an access group only if they are associated with a role that has permission to do so.  Administrators may be associated with multiple roles, and roles may be associated with many access groups. You can manage roles from the **Roles** tab in your organization's home page.
