# Administrators

**Administrators** are people who are authorized to manage computers using Landscape. You can manage administrators from the **Administrators** tab in your organization's home page.

In the **Administrators** tab, the upper part of the screen displays a list of existing administrators and their email addresses. If you're running self-hosted Landscape, the first user you create automatically becomes an administrator of your account. If you're using Landscape SaaS, Canonical sends you an administrator invitation when your account is created. After that, you must create additional administrators yourself. You're encouraged to carefully consider who you make an administrator because administrators have elevated permissions and can make changes that affect users and the entire system.
