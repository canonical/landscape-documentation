# Administrators

**Administrators** are people who are authorized to manage computers using Landscape. 

If you're running self-hosted Landscape, the first user you create automatically becomes an administrator of your account. If you're using Landscape SaaS, Canonical sends you an administrator invitation when your account is created. After that, you must invite additional administrators yourself. You're encouraged to carefully consider who you make an administrator because administrators have elevated permissions and can make changes that affect users and the entire system.

## Managing administrators
### In the new web portal
You can manage administrators in the **Administrators** tab under **Org. settings**. From this view you can add, remove, and invite administrators. You can also grant or revoke [roles](/reference/terms/roles) for each administrator. 

### In the classic web portal
On the **Administrators** tab in your organization's homepage, you can see a list of administrators and their email addresses. Further down, you can also view pending administrator invitations and invite more administrators. On the **Roles** tab you can adjust administrators' permissions with a membership matrix. For more details on roles, see the [reference page](/reference/terms/roles).

### Via the API
See the API reference for interacting with administrators through the [REST API](/reference/api/rest-api-endpoints/administrators) and [legacy API](/reference/api/legacy-api-endpoints/administrators)
