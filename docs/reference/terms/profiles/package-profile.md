# Package profile

A **package profile**, or meta-package, comprises a set of one or more packages, including their dependencies and conflicts (generally called constraints), that you can manage as a group. Package profiles specify sets of packages that associated systems should always get, or never get. You can associate zero or more computers with each package profile via tags to install packages on those computers. You can also associate a package profile with an access group, which limits its use to only computers within the specified access group. You can manage package profiles from the **Profiles** tab in your organization's home page.

Package profiles are evaluated periodically, and can be used for ensuring compliance over time. If package profiles are used to install packages, it is important to ensure any prerequisite repository configurations have been applied so the package can be downloaded, otherwise the package profile will fail to install the package, and report the machine as non-compliant.
