# Pocket

A **pocket** is a system-defined section of packages within a package repository. Pockets are a concept from the [Ubuntu package archive](https://canonical-ubuntu-packaging-guide.readthedocs-hosted.com/en/latest/explanation/archive/#archivepockets) (and Debian), and they're used to organize packages based on their purpose or stage in the release process. Some examples commonly used in Landscape include `release`, `updates` and `security` pockets.

Landscape uses pockets for repository mirroring. For more information, see the [explanation on repository mirroring](https://ubuntu.com/landscape/docs/explanation-about-repository-mirroring).
