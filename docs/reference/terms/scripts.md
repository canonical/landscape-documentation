# Scripts

**Scripts** can be used to automate tasks, perform actions and make changes to multiple computers at once. Landscape lets you run scripts on the computers you manage in your account. The scripts may be in any language, as long as an interpreter for that language is present on the computers on which they are to run. You can maintain a library of scripts for common tasks. You can manage scripts from the **Scripts** tab in your organization's home page, and run them against computers from the **Scripts** menu in the **Computers** page.
