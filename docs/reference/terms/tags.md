# Tags

**Tags** are user-defined labels or metadata that can be used to organize your computers in Landscape. Landscape lets you group multiple computers by applying tags to them. You can group computers using any set of characteristics; architecture and location might be two logical tagging schemes. 

Tag names may use any combination of letters, numbers, and dashes, and each computer can be associated with multiple tags. There is no menu choice for tags; rather, you can select multiple computers from the **Computers** (or "Instances") page and apply or remove one or more tags to all the computers you select. If you want to specify more than one tag at a time for your selected computers, separate the tags by spaces.
