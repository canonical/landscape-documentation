# Tags

**Tags** are user-defined labels or metadata that can be used to organize your client instances in Landscape. Landscape lets you group multiple instances by applying tags to them. Tag names may use any combination of letters, numbers, and dashes, and each instance can be associated with multiple tags. You can group instances using any set of characteristics; Ubuntu series and location might be two logical tagging schemes. For example, if you are managing an instance based in London running on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish, you could associate both "jammy" and "eu-west-2" tags to it.
