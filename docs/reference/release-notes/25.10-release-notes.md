# 25.10 release notes

> Landscape 25.10 runs on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat or 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish. Database schema changes are required to upgrade to Landscape Server 25.10.

You can now access Landscape 25.10 in our `latest-stable` rolling release PPA: `ppa:landscape/latest-stable`.

Note that 25.10 is not an LTS release. For self-hosted production deployments, we recommend using an LTS release, such as {ref}`Landscape Server 24.04 LTS <reference-release-notes-24-04-lts>`, which come with 10 years of support.

## Highlights

- **WSL profiles**: Install selected WSL instances on Landscape-registered Windows clients. Ensure that only WSL instances matching your profile are installed. Choose from Ubuntu LTS images or supply your own image. Customize installed WSL instances with [cloud-init](https://cloud-init.io/).

- **Ubuntu Pro management**: Attach or detach [Ubuntu Pro](https://ubuntu.com/pro) tokens to managed instances or groups of managed instances. Get notified of upcoming Ubuntu Pro expiration dates up to 90 days in advance.

- **Provision Ubuntu installations with autoinstall**: The Ubuntu installer (24.04 and later) can use Landscape to serve an autoinstall file if an OIDC login method has been configured. Autoinstall files can be associated with OIDC-authenticated employees and automatically used to provision Ubuntu during installation. Find out more in our {ref}`Ubuntu installer documentation <how-to-guides-ubuntu-installer-provisioning-index>`.
