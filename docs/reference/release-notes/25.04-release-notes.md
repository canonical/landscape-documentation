# 25.04 release notes

```{note}
Support for Landscape 25.04 ended in October 2025.
```

> Landscape 25.04 runs on Ubuntu 24.04 LTS Noble Numbat or 22.04 LTS Jammy Jellyfish. Database schema changes are required to upgrade to Landscape Server 25.04.

You can now access Landscape 25.04 in our `latest-stable` rolling release PPA: `ppa:landscape/latest-stable`. 

Note that 25.04 is not an LTS release. For self-hosted production deployments, we recommend using an LTS release, such as {ref}`Landscape Server 24.04 LTS <reference-release-notes-24-04-lts>`, which come with 10 years of support.

## Highlights

- **Security Profiles**: Monitor up to 1000 compatible clients for CIS and DISA-STIG benchmark standards compliance using the [Ubuntu Security Guide](https://ubuntu.com/security/certifications/docs/2204/usg), including the ability to attempt automatic compliance fixes. Customize your benchmarks with tailoring files, collect compliance data over time and retain it for future reference or auditing purposes.

- **Script Profiles**: Manage event-based, scheduled, and recurring script execution on clients. Scripts can be executed on groups of clients as one-off or recurring actions, or in response to events such as Landscape registration.

- **Reboot Profiles**: Issue reboot commands to groups of clients on a regular schedule, ensuring that upgrades that require reboot are properly applied. Apply an expiration time limit to reboot activities and randomize delivery times to avoid rebooting all instances simultaneously.
