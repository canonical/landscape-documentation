## Upgrade Notes
Performing an in-place upgrade from Landscape 19.10 entails a fresh installation using either Juju, Quickstart, or a Manual installation; and restoring the database. Going forward, Juju is the recommended installation method. In the future, upgrading Landscape via Juju will be a two-step process: one command to pause Landscape, and one command to perform the upgrade.
