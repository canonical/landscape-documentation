# 23.10 release notes

```{note}
Support for Landscape 23.10 ended in April 2024. 
```

Landscape 23.10 is an interim release and is **not recommended for production use**. Interim releases provide access to upcoming features, but these releases are only supported for 6 months, until the next release is published. Production deployments should only use LTS releases, which come with 10 years of support.

## Highlights

- **Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)**: Use Landscape with WSL and Ubuntu Pro for Windows
- **Repository management dashboard**: Preview the new repository management dashboard for self-hosted Landscape users.
- **JWT-Authentication for all API endpoints**: Introduced JWT-authentication as an option for all API endpoints. This feature is only available for users who don’t authenticate using SSO or OIDC at this time.
- **Auto-registration toggle:** Automatically register new computers when they’re registered using a registration key.
- **New `--method` parameter for `landscape-api`:** Use the new `--method` parameter to specify the HTTP method when making API calls.
- **Landscape Client - `landscape-config` changes:** The `landscape-config` command can now start the `landscape-client` systemd service.
- **Landscape Client - updated ping protocol:** Clients now use HTTPS (instead of HTTP) when pinging the message server for updates.
