# Computers


The methods available here give the ability to retrieve computers and to do basic operations on them, such as tagging.

## GetComputers

Get a list of computers associated with the account.

- `query`: A query string with space-separated tokens used to filter the returned computers. Words provided as search parameters are treated as keywords, matching the hostname or the computer title. Selector prefixes can be used to further customize the search.
- `tag`: Search for computers with the specified tag.
- `distribution`: Search for computers running a specific Ubuntu release (can be code name like `jammy` or version number like `22.04`).
- `hostname`: Search for computers with the exact hostname.
- `title`: Search for computers with the exact title.
- `alert`: Search for computers with a named alert being active. Alerts can be one of the following: `package-upgrades`, `security-upgrades`, `package-profiles`, `package-reporter`, `computer-offline`, `computer-reboot`.
- `access-group`: Search for computers that belong to the access group with the specified name.
- `id`: Select the specified numeric computer ID.
- `mac`: Search for computers with the specified MAC address, which can be a substring of the full address.
- `ip`: Search for computers with the specified IP address, which can be a substring of the full address. No network classing is done.
- `search`: Select computers based on the result of the named search.
- `needs:reboot`: Search for computers that have the reboot required flag set. Note that with this particular criteria, the only possible value for it is the text `reboot`.
- `license-id`: Search for computers licensed to the specified `license-id`.
- `needs:license` OR `license-id:none`: Search for computers that do not have a Landscape license, and, as a result, are not managed.
- `annotation`: Search for computers which define the specified annotation key. Optionally specify `annotation:<key>:<string>` which will only return computers whose key matches and value also contains the `<string>` specified.
- `OR`: Search for computers matching term A or term B. `OR` must be in all-caps.
- `NOT`: search for computers not matching the next term. `NOT` must be in all-caps.

If values following a prefix contain spaces or non-ASCII characters, they must be in quotation marks.

These prefixes can be mixed and matched with keywords. For example, the following query would match computers with ‘appserver’ in their title or hostname, either with the tag "server" or running the "jammy" release of Ubuntu:

```text
appserver tag:server OR distribution:jammy
```

The `GetComputers` method also supports the following optional arguments:

- `limit`: The maximum number of results returned by the method. It defaults to 1000.
- `offset`: The offset inside the list of results.
- `with_network`: If true, include the details of all network devices attached to the computer.
- `with_hardware`: If true, include the details of all hardware information known.
- `with_annotations`: If true, include the details of all custom annotation information known.

For example, the following request searches for all computers with the tag "server", includes their network devices, and with a limit of 20 machines:

```text
?action=GetComputers&query=tag:server&limit=20&with_network=true
```

The method returns a JSON serialized list of computers:

```text
[{"access_group": "global",
  "comment": u"",
  "distribution": u"22.04",
  "hostname": u"a_comp.example.com",
  "id": 12345,
  "last_ping_time": None,
  "last_exchange_time": "2023-06-3017:59Z",
  "title": u"A Computer",
  "reboot_required_flag": False,
  "tags": ["server"],
  "total_memory": None,
  "total_swap": None,
  "network_devices": [{"broadcast_address": "192.168.1.255",
                       "interface": "eth0",
                       "ip_address": "192.168.1.2",
                       "mac_address": "00:1e:c9:6c:b8:de",
                       "netmask": "255.255.255.0"}]}]
```

The JSON equivalent of this output is:

```text
[
    {
        "access_group": "global",
        "comment": "",
        "distribution": "22.04",

        "title": "A Computer",
        "reboot_required_flag": false,
        "tags": [
            "server"
        ],
        "total_memory": "None",
        "total_swap": "None",
        "network_devices": [

            }
        ]
    }
