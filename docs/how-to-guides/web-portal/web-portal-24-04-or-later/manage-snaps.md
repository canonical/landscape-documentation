This tab displays a list of installed snaps, including the name, channel, version, and whether the snap is held at a specific version.

You can search for specific snaps using the search bar.

## Refresh (upgrade), remove or hold snaps for a specific computer

To manage snaps on a specific computer, navigate to the **Snaps** tab:

- To refresh (upgrade) a snap, select the checkboxes for each snap you want to refresh and click **Refresh**. Specify the delivery information then click **Refresh**.
- To remove a snap, select the checkboxes for each snap you want to remove and click **Uninstall**. Specify the delivery information then click **Uninstall**
- To hold a snap, select the checkboxes for each snap you want to hold and click **Hold**. Specify the delivery information then click **Hold**
  - Note: “Holding” a snap prevents the snap from upgrading in the background. It’ll stay locked to that version until you remove the hold, but you can still manually refresh (upgrade) the snap.
- To remove a hold, select the checkboxes for each snap you want to unhold and click **Unhold**. Specify the delivery information then click **Unhold**
