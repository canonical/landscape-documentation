These guides describe how to manage additional administrators and roles. 

## Invite administrators

You can make someone an administrator by sending them an invitation via email. To invite an administrator:

1. Click **Org. Settings** > **Administrators** from the side bar
2. Click **Invite administrator**
3. Enter the requested information
4. Click **Send invite**

The invitation will send from the email address you specified during the Landscape setup. The options available in the **Roles** section are the same roles defined in the **Roles** section.

Users who receive an invitation will see an HTML link in the email. Clicking this link takes them to a page where they’re asked to log in to Landscape. Once they do, they gain the administrator privileges associated with the role to which they’ve been assigned.

The first person to click on the link and submit information becomes an administrator, even if it’s not the person with the name and email address to which you sent the invitation. Take care to keep track of the status of administrator invitations.

## Remove administrators

To remove an administrator from Landscape:

1. Click **Org. Settings** > **Administrators** from the side bar
2. Click the name of the administrator you want to remove
3. Click **Remove**

The administrator will be permanently removed from Landscape. Although this operation can’t be reversed, you can send another administrator invitation to the same email address.

## Create roles

To add a new role:

1. Click **Org. Settings** > **Roles** from the side bar
2. Click **Add role**
3. Complete the requested information for the role
4. Click **Add**

When you add a role, you also specify a set of one or more access groups to which the role applies, and what permissions you want the role to have.

By specifying different permission levels and different access groups, you can create roles and associate them with administrators to get a granular level of control over sets of computers.
