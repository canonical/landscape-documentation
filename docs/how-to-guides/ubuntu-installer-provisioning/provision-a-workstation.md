# How to provision a workstation using Landscape and the Ubuntu installer

Recent releases of the Ubuntu installer (24.04+) can use Landscape to serve an autoinstall file.
This is available on self-hosted and SaaS Landscape.
On SaaS Landscape, your account must be hosted on a subdomain.
Your Landscape account must use OIDC authentication. Currently, only Google OAuth 2.0 is supported.

WIP:

- Choose Landscape provisioning in the installer
- Use your attach code to authenticate against Landscape
- Log in against your identity provider
