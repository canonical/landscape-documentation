# How to install and configure Landscape for high-availability deployments

> See also: [Juju documentation](https://juju.is/docs/juju)

You can create a scalable, high availability (HA) deployment of Landscape Server by using Juju and the [Landscape Scalable](https://charmhub.io/landscape-scalable) charm bundle. The result is a Juju-managed deployment of Landscape Server and the other services it depends on: HAProxy, RabbitMQ Server, and PostgreSQL.

Each of these services will have an independently scalable number of Juju units. Depending on your Juju cloud configuration, these units can be deployed to different availability zones to further improve resilience.

This is a simplified model of a full Landscape HA deployment:

## Prerequisites

Before you can deploy the Landscape Scalable charm bundle, you need to:

  1. [Install the Juju client](https://juju.is/docs/juju/install-and-manage-the-client)
  1. [Add a machine cloud to Juju](https://juju.is/docs/juju/manage-clouds)
  
These steps lay the groundwork for using Juju to deploy [machine charms](https://juju.is/charms-architecture).

Machine charms are Juju-managed applications deployed on bare-metal servers, virtual machines, or system containers such as [LXD](https://canonical.com/lxd). Landscape is only one of many charms that can be deployed from [Charmhub](https://charmhub.io/) and managed by Juju. Juju handles installing the applications and configuring them to work together.
 
## Deploy the charm bundle

You can deploy the Landscape Scalable charm bundle using one of two main methods. The methods are:

  1. Deploy the bundle with the default configuration, then customize the configuration
  1. Download the bundle configuration, customize it, then deploy it
  
This guide describes both methods.

### Option 1: Deploy with the default configuration

Once you have a Juju machine cloud configured, deploying the charm bundle with the default configuration is relatively straightforward.

#### Step 1: Create a Juju model

```bash
juju add-model landscape-self-hosted
```

#### Step 2: Deploy `landscape-scalable`

You can deploy the `landscape-scalable` charm bundle directly.

```bash
juju deploy landscape-scalable
```

It will take some time for the bundle to finish deploying. You can watch the deployment progress with `juju status`:

```bash
juju status --watch 3s
```

`--watch` refreshes the status periodically. This example is set to refresh every three seconds.

You can also check the status at any time without `--watch`:

```bash
juju status
```

At first, the `juju status` output will indicate that all units are waiting for machines to become available:

```

3        pending           pending  ubuntu@22.04
```

Once everything is installed and settled, the `Status` for every application will be `active`:

```

3        started  10.76.244.71   juju-dded29-3  ubuntu@22.04      Running
```

#### Step 3: Add application units

The following commands add two units each of Landscape Server, HAProxy, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ. Execute them to create your high availability deployment with three units of each service.

```bash
juju add-unit landscape-server -n 2
juju add-unit haproxy -n 2
juju add-unit postgresql -n 2
juju add-unit rabbitmq-server -n 2
```

The charms for each application handle relationships between the units. The unit indicated with an asterisk (`*`) in the `juju status` output is the current leader unit.

After the new units are given machines and the charm installation and setup is complete, the result is a high availability deployment:

```

```

You now have Landscape Server set up for a high-availability deployment. Next, you need to set up your clients by [installing the Landscape Client charm](/how-to-guides/landscape-installation-and-set-up/install-landscape-client) on each client, and configuring them with [the `juju config` command](https://juju.is/docs/juju/juju-config). You may also need to change your SSL certificate configuration. See the [configure HAProxy with an SSL certificate](#configure-haproxy-with-an-ssl-certificate) section in this guide for more information.

### Option 2: Customize the configuration before deployment

If you would rather do all of your configuration up-front and then let Juju orchestrate everything during deployment, you can download the charm bundle's YAML file and customize it.

#### Step 1: Download the `landscape-scalable` charm bundle

```bash
juju download landscape-scalable
```

You'll get output similar to:

```
Fetching bundle "landscape-scalable" revision 37 using "stable" channel and base "amd64/ubuntu/22.04"
Install the "landscape-scalable" bundle with:
    juju deploy ./landscape-scalable_r37.bundle
```

Then, unzip it:

```bash
unzip ./landscape-scalable_r37.bundle
```

You'll get output similar to:

```
Archive:  ./landscape-scalable_r37.bundle
  inflating: bundle.yaml
  inflating: README.md
  inflating: manifest.yaml
```

#### Step 2: Edit the `bundle.yaml` file

You need to increase the `num_units` for each application to turn your deployment into a high availability deployment. In this example, we set each service to `num_units: 3`. This means there will be three units of each Landscape Server, HAProxy, PostgreSQL, and RabbitMQ.

```

#### Step 3: Deploy the `bundle.yaml` file

```bash
juju deploy ./bundle.yaml
```

It will take some time for the bundle to finish deploying, you can watch the deployment progress with `juju status`:

```bash
juju status --watch 3s
```

`--watch` refreshes the status periodically. This example is set to refresh every three seconds.

You can also check the status at any time without `--watch`:

```bash
juju status
```

At first, the `juju status` output will indicate that all units are waiting for machines to become available:

You now have Landscape Server set up for a high-availability deployment. Next, you need to set up your clients by [installing the Landscape Client charm](/how-to-guides/landscape-installation-and-set-up/install-landscape-client) on each client, and configuring them with [the `juju config` command](https://juju.is/docs/juju/juju-config). You may also need to change your SSL certificate configuration. See the [configure HAProxy with an SSL certificate](#configure-haproxy-with-an-ssl-certificate) section in this guide for more information.

## Configure HAProxy with an SSL certificate

If you followed the previous instructions in this guide, you'll have a Landscape Server high availability deployment. The HAProxy application in this deployment uses a self-signed SSL certificate for secure HTTPS. Landscape Clients and your browser won't trust this certificate by default.

If you have a valid SSL certificate, you can configure HAProxy to use it by executing the following `juju config` commands. `fullchain.pem` is the public, full-chain SSL certificate and `privkey.pem` is the certificate's private key.

```bash
juju config haproxy ssl_cert="$(base64 fullchain.pem)" ssl_key="$(base64 privkey.pem)"
```

Once your SSL certificate is in place, your Landscape Clients and browser should trust HTTPS connections to your Landscape Server deployment, so long as your certificate remains valid.
