# Landscape Documentation

Landscape is a systems management tool designed to help you manage and monitor your Ubuntu systems from a unified platform.

Landscape provides system administration for deployments at enterprise scale via a web portal and API. It streamlines functions including inventory management, automation, security hardening, compliance management, reporting and software distribution.

These administration tasks typically span multiple systems and interfaces, which can present challenges. Landscape reduces these challenges and simplifies administrative tasks by serving as a centralized hub that unifies these operations.

For system administrators, security analysts, CISOs and more, Landscape provides a flexible and efficient system management solution that can adapt to various organizational sizes, requirements and complexities.
